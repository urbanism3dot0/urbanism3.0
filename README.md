# URBANISM 3.0 — RESEARCH. 
## PROTOCOLS AND DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION PLATFORM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION URBANISM 3.0
##### The intend of Urbanism 3.0 is to enable the development of better cities, and novel forms of urban Governance. Urbanism 3.0 does this by building the ultimate abstract foundational layer for cities comprised of protocols and applications, built on top of a programmable blockchain allowing anyone  to create their own arbitrary rules  for urban developments<br> Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace, maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>
Ethereum, a blockchain computer that is fully programmable, has a unique property: It enables societies to write permanent code that has clear rules about how it will work in the future. That property has enabled the emergence of an independent field of knowledge and a space for innovation—The crypto-web3 domain.<br>
The integration of the crypto-web3 domain into the field of architecture and urbanism unlocks a completely new and innovative domain of projects and research, pushing the boundaries of these disciplines in new directions. 

The new crypto-urbanism domain make it possible to build novel models for cities on top of complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses based on collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of crypto-open internet—urbanism-[and architecture] become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.<br><br> 
We are only just beginning to explore the potential of crypto[graphy], open-internet and urbanism. There are already many challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this socio-technical urbanism movement successful. These challenges include developing a collective vision for the city of the future, translating political and social philosophy into an ecosystem of internet protocols, among other issues<br><br>

There is an opportunity for a community-collective to champion the production of the first collectively-owned Autonomous City, and create a new era for cities. Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The new crypto-urbanism [protocol and decentralized application platform] uses public-community partnerships to unlock the potential of communities to fund and finance new cities from scratch. <br><br>

note: the term "crypto" is a shortcut to "cryptographic blockchain technology"
  
## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH LAB
#### URBANISM 3.0 WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE OF CITIES AND FORM THE METROPOLIS OF THE FUTURE
We are introducing a research lab to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of Ethereum with the field of Urbanism and to help shape the ultimate abstract foundational layer for  Urbanism 3.0:  A decentralised platform comprised of protocols and applications, built on top of a programmable blockchain enabling anyone to build new private cities and create their own arbitrary rules for ownership and governance of the commons.<br><br>
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this project in which self-organised teams of international researchers come to the lab to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities. <br><br>
This is a new type of lab that is organized as a collective on blockchain and functions as a platform allowing communities to pool their resources and collectively fund research for the cities of the future.
The lab operates as an open-source research hub with permissionless access for open public discussion and joint development enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field.Its native token economy creates a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>
The lab is a work in progress that challenges the norms of how we conceive, build and live within our environment. The crypto-ubanism framework of research is comprised of three pillars
#### VISION
* DDRL will be the first lab to decentralise the process of creating a vision for the future of our cities. Details TBD.   
#### CITY FORMATION MODELS  
* Everything about design and growth models based on protocols 
#### PROTOCOLS  
* Urbanism 3.0 applications are standards specifying features or processes. They are based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).
* Oracles. TBD

## DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS
In general there are two types of applications on top of Urbanism 3.0 platform. The first category is protocols providing communities with more powerful ways of  managing and entering into public-community partnerships for building Autonomous cities and creating Special Economic Zones on blockchain. The second category is core protocols for developing novel forms of urbanism and governance of the commons.
### COLLECTIVE DEVELOPMENT: WEBUILD
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the "vision of the client" with citizens aas the consumers of the "product"<br><br>
Urbanism 3.0 flip this model on its head. It enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. 
By introducing a Urbanism 3.0 we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps to advance new private cities.
Urbanism 3.0 has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.

### THE AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL METROPOLIS: CYBER-URBAN COMMONS 3.0  
The vision for cyber urban worlds: <br>
Urbanism 3.0 introduces the concept of cyber urban commons 3.0. A class of protocols to connect a public good to a community-owned and operated network that collectively decide on the allocation of resources. <br>
Cyber urban commons 3.0 are decentralized applications to enable the deployment of the institutional structure of autonomous urban commons, a hybrid model of cooperative organizations on the blockchain around public goods.<br>
The city use the novel commons 3.0 mechanism to assign the creation, governance maintenance, and renewal of commonly shared resources to protocols that run on the open internet for the citizens to access and participate.<br>

The cyber urban commons 3.0 are public goods [resources] that benefit humanity. Commons 3.0 They are new classes of assets that generate revenue for the city which is distributed to the shareholders, "the citizens".

The urban commons 3.0 solves the problem of governing resources used by many individuals in common where collective action can either preserve the commons or deplete it.


#### This is the Urbanism 3.0 version of a public goods cooperative:<br> 
think of a community of people that vote for the production of electricity from fusion reactors. The community would own the reactors and contribute to the joint development of the cooperative, rather than the current model - where the electricity is produced by large corporations for private profit. The benefits of the commons are distributed among the members of the community who contribute to the development of the cooperative.<br>

Any type of organization in the public services sector, urban infrastructure or a Common resources, such as a natural jabitats, can be organized as a crypto-cooperatives. City 3.0 is a decentralized network of cooperatives that manage the commons. City 3.0 is also a public good that is jointly owned and managed by citizens, delegators and cooperatives.

#### Urban Governance is dynamic and programmable. 
Urbanism 3.0 provides a variety of models for community governance as code blocks allowing anyone to compose their own arbitrary rules for ownership, voting procedures, or delegation of voting power. The coordination costs can be radically reduced in new types of decentralized networks, in which smart contracts enable participants to govern cooperatively.


#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in public goods or a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes [insert]in the physical and cyberspace. It is a new way of managing and developing the city's assets that includes public goods, utilities, and natural resources. This type of ownership allows for collective governance and management of these assets for the benefit of the city as a whole.

### CONNECTED CYBER URBAN WORLDS
In its final form the Urbanism 3.0 exposes a metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environment. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.
The new  environment that enables cyber-to-urban interactions is where contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules

The token enables holders to participate in the decision making process and vote on the direction and implementation of the research 
The purpose of the token system is to enable the organic formation of permissionless working groups where everyone can participate and contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>
Additional features:
#### Decentralised Integrated storytelling: 
How $DDRL will enable a global community to link different stories together and collectively shape the visions of our collective futures?<br>
The challenge for cities will be to create stories that are compelling and interesting enough to get people to pay attention. They will also need to find ways to make sure that these stories are accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of technical expertise. 
$DDRL will be the first project to decentralise the process of creating a vision for the future of our cities. Each $DDRL holder serves as part of the storytelling process enabling them to vote on key aspects of a vision, including storyline, characters, and art.  

#### Exclusive Art and Behind-the-Scenes Access:
