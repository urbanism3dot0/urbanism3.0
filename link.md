Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to crypto-economic organisms â€” decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. The pairing of the cyber and physical world is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>
The "Hybrid Pair" protocol make possible a model of common resources ecosystems, where citizens, both individually and collectively own, govern, and make the most of their common resources. The interoperability between realities and systemsis achieved with a mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation<br>
In its final form Urbanism 3.0, exposes a metaverse-interface specifically designed to enable interactions from the cyber world to our physical urban and architectural environment. 
The cyber-to-real life metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that create a new era of [cyber-urban life] [insert] in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules<br><br>
The interoperability is a critical feature of Urbanism 3.0 and is only possible because the underlying blockchain technology provide a [insert] of distributed consensus among citizens.
What Urbanism 3.0 intends to provide is a programmable platform of composable code-protocols that can be used as lego blocks to assemble hierarchical meta-protocols to enable people to create collective participatory systems for the design, development, and governance of any the systems that comprise the complex system of the city. More particularly we can create: 
* Private cities. We can unlock the potential of communities to create public....
* Novel forms of Mega-cities that combine top down planning and organic formation of spatial configurations and human activities and by enabling citizens to participate in the urban creation process through decentralized social consensus. We can 
* Autonomous Crypto-Economic Zones entirely on blockchain with Real-Time Risk managment 
* Governance through Autonomous Markets
A Pair can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons

The intention of Urbanism 3.0 is to create a programmable working framework for applied research, enable societies harness the power of urbanization, by building more and better cities. Urbanism 3.0 requires two key elements: 
#### A programmable platform of composable code-blocks, 
code-blocks built on top of a programmable blockchain to allow for the assembly of hierarchical meta-protocols from mix and match lego bricks.<br>
#### Hybrid pair protocols. 
A novel type of mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation. This includes:

* Solving The Climate Change incentives problem
This would also enable novel form of incentives structures that would help solve the climate change problem if combined with inventive engineering.

* Joint development of cities with Public-community partnerships.
providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts

Urbanism 3.0 enables the combination of top down urban planning and organic formation of cities by enabling citizens to participate in the urban creation process through decentralized social consensus.
