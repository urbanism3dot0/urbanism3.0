Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to crypto-economic organisms â€” decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. The pairing of the cyber and physical world is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>
The "Hybrid Pair" protocol make possible a model of common resources ecosystems, where citizens, both individually and collectively own, govern, and make the most of their common resources. The interoperability between realities and systemsis achieved with a mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation<br>
In its final form Urbanism 3.0, exposes a metaverse-interface specifically designed to enable interactions from the cyber world to our physical urban and architectural environment. 
The cyber-to-real life metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that create a new era of [cyber-urban life] [insert] in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules<br><br>
The interoperability is a critical feature of Urbanism 3.0 and is only possible because the underlying blockchain technology provide a [insert] of distributed consensus among citizens.
What Urbanism 3.0 intends to provide is a programmable platform of composable code-protocols that can be used as lego blocks to assemble higher order systems that include: Autonomous design systems, self-organizing based o protocols, for the city to enable people to create collective participatory systems for the design, development, and governance of any the systems that comprise the complex system of the city. 
More particularly we can create: 
* Private cities and Autonomous Crypto-Economic Zones entirely on blockchain. We can unlock the potential of communities to create public....
* Public-community partnerships
* Novel forms of Mega-cities that combine top down planning and organic formation of spatial configurations and human activities and by enabling citizens to participate in the urban creation process through decentralized social consensus. We can 
*  with Real-Time Risk managment 
* Governance through Autonomous Markets
A Pair can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons

Urbanism 3.0 offers alternatives for how societies should design and develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.

intends to create a programmable platform for applied research, that takes design, economics and policy as input to enable programmable protocols that 

#### Hybrid pair protocols. 
A novel type of mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation. This includes:

* Solving The Climate Change incentives problem
This would also enable novel form of incentives structures that would help solve the climate change problem if combined with inventive engineering.

* Joint development of cities with Public-community partnerships.
providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts

Urbanism 3.0 enables the combination of top down urban planning and organic formation of cities by enabling citizens to participate in the urban creation process through decentralized social consensus.

## The Collective Institute
We are introducing a decentralized institute to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of WEB3 with the field of Urbanism and to help form Urbanism 3.0 as an area of study and applied research.
The urbanism 3.0 collective: an experiment to enable decentralised participation  of people to jointly contribute to the development of an Institution backed by fractional ownership of the institution itself, thus providing a way to align incentives and share the benefits of future outcomes.
The Institute is an experiment in collective participation. It starts as a collective loosely organized on the Ethereum network as a community with a membership token in common and nothing more than a mutual understanding where we want to go.<br>


## The mission
The mission of the Decentralized Collective Institute of Urbanism 3.0 DCIU3) is to establish a new theoretical and applied research platform to create knowledge and decentralized applications that can be used to create more and better cities faster and harness the power of urbanization to bring up to the world standard entire regions.<br>

Why do we need Urbanism 3.0?
