Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to crypto-economic organisms â€” decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. The pairing of the cyber and physical world is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>
To enable its functionality Urbanism 3.0 provides a platform of code-blocks built on top of a programmable blockchain to allow for the assembly of meta-protocols as mix and match lego bricks.
The intention of Urbanism 3.0 is to provide Hybrid pair contracts. A novel type of mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation of physical assets and property rights  on chain,  verified by access through oracles, to real-world data and off-chain computation, enables a new categories of applications. This includes:
* Governance through Autonomous Markets
A Pair can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons

* Solving The Climate Change incentives problem
This would also enable novel form of incentives structures that would help solve the climate change problem if combined with inventive engineering.

* Joint development of cities with Public-community partnerships.
providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts

Urbanism 3.0 enables the combination of top down urban planning and organic formation of cities by enabling citizens to participate in the urban creation process through decentralized social consensus.
