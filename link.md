Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to crypto-economic organisms â€” decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. Urbanism 3.0 pairs a virtual, online cyberspace with the physical world, the urban environment. The pair is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>

In its final form, the shared state is a metaverse populated by avatar representations of real people and is specifically designed to enable interactions from the cyber world to our physical urban and architectural environment. Interactions among people, avatars and software bots create a new era of cyber-urban life [insert] in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules<br><br>

Ultimately Urbanism 3.0 create alternative models and methods for how societies should design and develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens.
To do this Urbanism 3.0 creates a decentralized porgrammable framework for creating pairs of cyber physical assets that are programmable and can be assemblied like lego bricks to create higher order structures. The applications we can create using these  components include: 
* Autonomous self-organizing growth and spatial configuration systems combined with top down planning and zoning
* and Public-community partnerships.
to enable Joint development of cities providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts
* The "Hybrid Pair" protocol make possible a model of common resources ecosystems, where citizens, both individually and collectively own, govern, and make the most of their common resources. The interoperability between realities and systemsis achieved with a mechanism specifically designed to connect any type of common resource, organization or property right to a digital asset creating a "hybrid-pair". The digital representation on-chain of physical assets and property rights, is verified by access to real-world data and off-chain computation<br>
* Decentralized Cooperative structures 
* Governance through Autonomous Markets
A Pair can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons
*  with Real-Time Risk managment 
* Solving The incentives problem Climate Change 
This would also enable novel form of incentives structures that would help solve the climate change problem if combined with inventive engineering.

## The Institute
We are introducing a decentralized institute to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of web3 with the field of Urbanism and to help form Urbanism 3.0 as an area of study and applied research. The purpose of the institute is to use Urbanism 3.0 to create more and better cities faster and harness the power of urbanization to bring up to the world standard entire regions.<br>

## The Collective
The urbanism 3.0 collective: an experiment to enable decentralised participation  of people to jointly contribute to the development of an Institution backed by fractional ownership of the institution itself, thus providing a way to align incentives and share the benefits of future outcomes.<br>
We identify opportunity in:
Public-Community partnerships in Crypto Economic Zones. There is an opportunity for a decentralized cooperative to champion the production of the first collectively-owned Autonomous City, and create a new era for cities. The Institute aims to become a...



## The mission
The mission of the Decentralized Collective Institute of Urbanism 3.0 DCIU3) is:
* to establish a new theoretical and applied research platform to create knowledge and decentralized applications. .<br>
* To identify and create opportunities
* to sustainably fund applied research




There is an opportunity for a new type of institute for urabnism 3.0 that operates as an open-source research and education hub with permissionless access enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field. Our vision is to sustainably fund applied research and put Urbanism 3.0 in the center of climate change

## !
The Institute starts as a collective loosely organized on the Ethereum network as a community with a membership token in common and nothing more than a mutual understanding where we want to go.<br>
