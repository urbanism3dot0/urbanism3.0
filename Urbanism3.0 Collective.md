Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. Pairing is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>

Urbanism 3.0 does this by providing the ultimate abstract foundational layer built on top of a programmable blockchain: A platform where we can mix and match code-blocks, protocols, to create city-specific decentralized applications for the governance of the commons, the design, planning and development of cities 

communities can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership and governance of the commons and program  to connect the physical and the cybers space, allowing communities to collectively form the cities of the future. <br><br>

The intention of urbanism 3.0 is to harness the transformational power of urbanization, open up and scale the production of private cities, and bring up a region to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.<br><br>


Urbanism 3.0 offers a better model for how societies should design and develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. In 1961 urbanist Jane Jacobs called city planning a pseudoscience. Urbanism 3.0 flip  urbanism on its head. In this way, the domain of Urbanism 3.0 become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.

### Urbanism 3.0 Collective

We are introducing the urbanism 3.0 collective: an experiment to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of an Institution backed by fractional ownership of the institution itself, thus providing a way to align incentives and share the benefits of future outcomes.

There is an opportunity for a new type of institute for urabnism 3.0 that operates as an open-source research and education hub with permissionless access  enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field. Our vision is to sustainably fund applied research and put Urbanism 3.0 in the center of climate change 


### ECONOMICS

Urbanism 3.0 collective is organised with the use of an NFT split in 16,969,696,969 $U3 fractions. This allows anyone to purchase a membership to the network: An independent decentralized network, deployed as a cooperative on a blockchain.


#### Revenue is distributed to public goods


#### PHASE 0: Token distribution


#### PHASE 1: Token distribution




EVENT DESCRIPTION
#### Create a decentralized network
* Citizens to contribute. a global community to link different stories together and collectively shape the visions of our collective futures!

Territorial Agency is engaged to strengthen the capacity of local and international communities 
*

#### Create an ecosystem of applications and protocols
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this institute in which self-organised teams of international researchers join to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities.


#### Distribute value to all participants

* the value created is distributed back to the citizens


 transforming urbanism from a practice 

 


URBANISM 3.0 COLLECTIVE: JOINT DEVELOPMENT

Urbanism 3.0 flip this model on its head. It enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. By introducing a Urbanism 3.0 we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps to advance new private cities. Urbanism 3.0 has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.
