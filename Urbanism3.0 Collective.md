Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. Pairing is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.


The intention is [to create novel design process that will allow us to] invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses with collective ownership and decentralized governance cooperative networks. The intention of the new model is to harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.


of an autonomous crypto economic zone at a specific geographic location that have the capacity to create their own arbitrary rules for development and governance of the commons.  The City has mechanisms to assign the creation, governance maintenance, and renewal of commonly shared resources to protocols that run on the open internet. for the citizens to access and participate.
allowing anyone to create their own arbitrary rules for urban developments
----------------------------------------------------------

Urbanism 3.0 does this by building the ultimate abstract foundational layer for cities comprised of protocols and applications, built on top of a programmable blockchain.



The new novel models for cities build on top of complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses based on collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of Urbanism 3.0 become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.

We are introducing the urbanism 3.0 collective as an NFT split in 16,969,696,969 $U3 fractions. This allows anyone to purchase a membership to the network: An independent decentralized network, deployed as a cooperative on a blockchain. It is an experiment dedicated to:
#### Create a decentralized network
* Citizens to contribute. a global community to link different stories together and collectively shape the visions of our collective futures!

Territorial Agency is engaged to strengthen the capacity of local and international communities 
*


#### Create an ecosystem of applications and protocols
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this institute in which self-organised teams of international researchers join to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities.


#### Distribute value to all participants

* the value created is distributed back to the citizens


The fractional city offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. 
Urbanism 3.0 is a task to large for any 


URBANISM 3.0 COLLECTIVE: JOINT DEVELOPMENT

Urbanism 3.0 flip this model on its head. It enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. By introducing a Urbanism 3.0 we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps to advance new private cities. Urbanism 3.0 has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.
