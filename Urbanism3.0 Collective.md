Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace. Pairing is achieved and maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>

Urbanism 3.0 does this by providing the ultimate abstract foundational layer for cities built on top of a programmable blockchain: A  platform where we can program protocols and decentralized applications that require distributed consensus among citizens allowing anyone to create and test their own arbitrary rules for the cities of the future. <br><br>
In general, there are three categories of applications on top of Urbanism 3.0:

The first category makes possible a model of common resources ecosystems, in three types of environments, the cyber, the urban and the Earth's, where citizens, both individually and collectively own, govern, and make the most of their common resources. To do this we create programmatically a digital asset on-blockchain and assign it, through a protocol, to a property right of a public good. With this process we create a "pair" of a property right with a digital asset. All types of common resources and property rights can be organised as pairs. Possible Pools of pairs include: the public space, urban infrastructure such as roads, public utility corporation for energy production, and ofcourse the commons. Pairs can be traded with decentralized Autonomous Market Maker enabling novel forms of assets and governance of the commons.
Pairs of crypto-commons represent a new class of protocols to connect a public good to a community-owned and operated network that collectively decide on the allocation of resources.

This in turn enable the deployment of a hybrid model of cooperative organizations with decentralized structure on the blockchain around public goods and distributed consensus. <br><br>
The second category is applications for the development of cities, providing communities with more powerful ways of building cities collectively and entering into public-community contracts using their money. This includes creating and managing special crypto-economic zones, sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts.<br><br>

The third category is applications for the design of cities, providing communities with more powerful ways of designing  cities to enable our collective future. 

There is an opportunity to use the above mentioned protocols to create novel rule-based design system and process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms of regional metropolisses with collective ownership, decentralized governance and cooperative networks. 
The intention of urbanism 3.0 is to harness the transformational power of urbanization, open up and scale the production of private cities, and bring up a region to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.<br><br>


Urbanism 3.0 offers a better model for how societies should design and develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. In 1961 urbanist Jane Jacobs called city planning a pseudoscience. Urbanism 3.0 flip  urbanism on its head. In this way, the domain of Urbanism 3.0 become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.

### Urbanism 3.0 Collective

We are introducing the urbanism 3.0 collective: an experiment to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of an Institution backed by fractional ownership of the institution itself, thus providing a way to align incentives and share the benefits of future outcomes.

There is an opportunity for a new type of institute that operates as an open-source research hub with permissionless access for open public discussion and joint development enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field.


is organized as a decentralized cooperative on blockchain and functions as a platform allowing communities to pool their resources and collectively fund research for the cities of the future. The institute 
to create a decentralized organization dedicated to growing the ecosystem, developing applied research, and establishing urbanism 3.0 as a new area of study. 

as an NFT split in 16,969,696,969 $U3 fractions. This allows anyone to purchase a membership to the network: An independent decentralized network, deployed as a cooperative on a blockchain. It is an experiment dedicated to:
#### Create a decentralized network
* Citizens to contribute. a global community to link different stories together and collectively shape the visions of our collective futures!

Territorial Agency is engaged to strengthen the capacity of local and international communities 
*

#### Create an ecosystem of applications and protocols
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this institute in which self-organised teams of international researchers join to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities.


#### Distribute value to all participants

* the value created is distributed back to the citizens


 transforming urbanism from a practice 

 


URBANISM 3.0 COLLECTIVE: JOINT DEVELOPMENT

Urbanism 3.0 flip this model on its head. It enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. By introducing a Urbanism 3.0 we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps to advance new private cities. Urbanism 3.0 has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.
