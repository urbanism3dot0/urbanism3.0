## Designing Web3 Futures to Change the World
The idea that web3  can inform the design of a better tomorrow is a powerful one and we need to make it a movement. 
Web3 state machines provide the foundational layer to design and prototype complex socio-economic and political systems of the future. In doing so, they allow us to not just tinker with the status quo, but to dismantling it and build something better in its place.  We need to show people that another world is possible, and that web3 can help us get there. If we can show that web3  can help to create a brighter future and maps the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome. <br>

This transformational power remains unused because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design radical new solutions that disrupt conventional thinking and that inform a rich and unexpected world without deep collaboration between multiple stakeholders of all types including communities and local governance.<br>

This is the greates barrier that prevents web3 from entering into complex fields in real life. That is possibly a strong reason why the development of Web3 applications is being kept inside the internet bubble and the alternative banking. Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.<br>
