## Designing Web3 Futures to Change the World
The idea that Web3 tech can form the foundational layer to imagine and prototype complex socio-economic and political systems of the future, has the potential to change the world. Web3 also provides the technology stack and tools for realizing these worlds. If web3 can demonstrate a brighter future and maps the path to it, we will all rush towards that outcome and that will create a movement that will benefit humanity and the planet.<br>

This transformational power remains unused because it is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design radical new solutions that disrupt conventional thinking and that inform a rich and unexpected world without deep collaboration between multiple stakeholders of all types including communities and local governance.<br>

This is the greates barrier that prevents web3 from entering into complex fields in real life. That is possibly a strong reason why the development of Web3 applications is being kept inside the internet bubble and the alternative banking. Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade.<br>
